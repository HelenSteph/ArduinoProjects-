 # Keyboard Pedal with Arduino
   
   Different control for a Keyboard based on a pedal and two pushbuttons. The main idea of this project is to create a different control for writing, so it can be used with the feet. 
   In this project I worked with the collaboration of [Sarah Liriano] (https://www.sarahlirianoportfolio.com). 
   
   The schematic design made on fritzing is available under this folder. The  pedal is a guitar pedal  connected to a driver with Arduino.
